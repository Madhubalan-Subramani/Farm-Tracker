Farm Tracker is a comprehensive web application designed to help farmers and farm workers efficiently track and manage their cultivation activities. Whether you're cultivating your own farm or working on othersâ€™ land, Farm Tracker allows you to record detailed information such as:

Who performed the cultivation

When the cultivation took place

Which equipment (e.g., tractor) was used

Duration of the work

With these records, users can easily monitor farm activities over time, filter and search past entries based on multiple criteria, and gain valuable insights into labor and resource usage. This helps in organizing work more effectively, improving productivity, and maintaining accurate farm logs.

Farm Tracker offers real-time data updates to keep everyone informed and streamline farm management.
